# Brain Tumor Segmentation using U-Net in TensorFlow

This project implements a deep learning-based semantic segmentation model to identify and segment brain tumors from MRI scans. Using a U-Net architecture, the model learns to distinguish tumor regions from the background in medical images.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

- **Goal**: Accurately segment tumor regions from brain MRI images using deep learning.
- **Dataset**: Brain tumor segmentation dataset with paired images and masks.
- **Architecture**: U-Net convolutional neural network implemented in TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Platform**: Developed locally in VS Code with GPU support.
